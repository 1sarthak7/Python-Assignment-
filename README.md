# Python-Assignment

This repository contains multiple **Python programs** created as part of my **Python programming class assignment**. Each file focuses on practicing core Python concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic object-oriented programming.

##  Project Structure

The repository includes the following Python files:

* `Q_1.py` – Basic Python problem solution (introductory concepts)
* `Q_2.py` – Conditional statements and logic-based problem
* `Q_3.py` – Loop-based or function-based Python program
* `Q_7.py` – Additional problem focusing on applied logic
* `bank_acc.py` – Simple **Bank Account system** demonstrating OOP concepts
* `car_display.py` – Program to display car-related details using classes
* `lib_books.py` – Library books management program (basic data handling)
* `fun_music.py` – Fun program related to music or sound-based logic

> Each file is written independently and can be executed separately.
